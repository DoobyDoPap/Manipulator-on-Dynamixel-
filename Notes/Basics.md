# MANIPULATOR KINEMATICS
In our project, the manipulator's task involves a pick-and-place operation where the end-effector needs to be positioned correctly to perform specific actions. Similar to tasks like grasping and drilling, achieving the right end-effector position and orientation is crucial for successful pick-and-place.
## Degree Of Freedom
The degree of freedom (DOF) refers to the number of independent ways a rigid body can move within a given space. In the context of robotics and mechanical systems, the degree of freedom indicates the number of independent joint variables required to specify the pose or configuration of a mechanism.
## Forward Kinematics
The process of finding the position/orientation of the end-effector when given a set of joint angles is known as forward kinematics.
## Inverse Kinematics
The process of finding the joint angles when given position/orientation of the end-effector is known as inverse kinematics.
# Dynamixel Motors
Dynamixel motors are a series of smart actuators developed by ROBOTIS. They are widely used in robotics for their high performance, precise control, and advanced features.
## *Why Dynamixel Motors are preferred?*
1. Dynamixel is compatible with various programming environments, including:
    Roboplus, the visual software by Robotis dedicated to programming Dynamixel servo motors.
    The SDK (access to source codes and libraries for Windows, Linux and smartphones) C/C++, JAVA, MATLAB, LABVIEW, ROS.
2. Data feedback and control: position, speed, temperature, torque, etc.
3. Different Dynamixel models cater to various applications, including servo motors, continuous rotation actuators, and even specialized motors for pan-tilt systems, humanoid robots, and more.
4. These servos operate on a high voltage and low power consumption, meaning greater battery stability.
## Industrial Applications

1.**Robotic Manipulators and Arms:**
Dynamixel motors are often used in industrial robotic manipulators and arms for tasks such as pick-and-place, assembly, welding, and packaging. Their accurate position control and feedback capabilities ensure precise and repeatable motion.

2.**Semiconductor Manufacturing:**
Dynamixel motors can be employed in semiconductor manufacturing equipment for wafer handling, alignment, and other critical tasks that demand precise motion control in a cleanroom environment.

3.**Pharmaceutical Production:**
In pharmaceutical manufacturing, Dynamixel motors can be used for automated dispensing, liquid handling, and labeling applications.
